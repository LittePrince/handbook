### Pitches

#### Elevator pitch

GitLab is an integrated product for the entire software development life-cycle. It contains chat, issue tracking, kanban boards, version control, continuous integration, release automation, and monitoring. 2/3 of the organizations that self-host git use GitLab, that are more than 100,000 organizations and millions of users.

#### Is it similar to GitHub?

GitLab started as an open source alternative to GitHub.
Instead of focusing on hosting open source projects we focused on the needs of the enterprise, for example we have 5 authorization levels vs. 2 in GitHub.
Now we've expanded the feature set with continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring.

#### What is the benefit?

We help organizations reduce the cycle time between having an idea and seeing it in production.
Before GitLab you needed 7 tools, it took a lot of effort to [integrate](http://www.thereflex.com/_pdfs/bob_or_fully_integrated_enterprise.pdf) them, and you end up with have different setups for different teams.
With GitLab you get data on how long each part of the software development life-cycle is taking and how you can improve it.

#### Email intro

GitLab makes it easier for companies to achieve software excellence so that they can unlock great software for their customers by reducing the cycle time between having an idea and seeing it in production. GitLab does this by having an [integrated product](http://www.thereflex.com/_pdfs/bob_or_fully_integrated_enterprise.pdf) for the entire software development life-cycle. It contains not only issue management, version control and code review but also Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and monitoring. Organization all around the world, big and small, are using GitLab. In fact, 2/3 of organizations that self-host git use GitLab. That is more than 100,000 organizations and millions of users.

#### [GitLab Positioning](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/positioning-faq/)

### Market segmentation
Sales segments the market based on IT or [TEDD](https://discoverorg.com/discoverorg-sales-intelligence-platform/data-sets-for-marketing-sales-and-staffing/technology-engineering-design-and-development-tedd-dataset/) employees
1. Strategic: 5000+ employees
2. Large: 750 - 4999 employees
3. Mid Market: 100 - 749 employees
4. SMB: less than 100 employees

We have two sales positions focused on selling into these markets.
1. Sr. Account Executive for Strategic and Large Accounts
2. Account Executive for Mid Market Accounts
3. SMB is our transactional business, managed by the Business Development Team and processed through our web portal.

Expected quota for each sales segment is:
1. Strategic Account Leader - Strategic/Large Accounts is $1.25M incremental annual contract value (ACV)
3. Account Executive - Mid-Market accounts is $750,000 incremental ACV

Quotas may be adjusted based on geographic region.

### GitLab Usage Statistics

Using [GitLab Version Check](/handbook/sales-process/version_check), GitLab usage data is pushed into Salesforce for both CE, EE and EE trial users. Once in Salesforce application, you will see a tab called "Usage Statistics".  Using the drop down view, you can select CE, EE Trails or EE to see all usage data sent to Gitlab.
Since version check is pulling the host name, the lead will be recorded as the host name.  Once you have identifed the correct company name, please update the company name. Example: change gitlab.boeing.com to Boeing as the company name.

To view the usage, click the hyperlink under the column called "Usage Statistics".  The link will consist of several numbers and letters like, a3p61012001a002.
You can also access usage statistics on the account object level within Salesforce.  Within the account object, there is a section called "Usage Ping Data", which will contain the same hyperlink as well as a summary of version they are using, active users, historical users, license user count, license utilization % and date data was sent to us.

A few example of how to use Usage Statistics to pull insight and drive action?
* If prospecting into CE users, you can sort by active users to target large CE instances. You can see what they are using within GitLab, like issues, CI build, deploys, merge requests, boards, etc.  You can then target your communications to learn how they are using GitLab internally and educate them on what is possible with EE.
* For current EE users who are below their license utilization, you can engage the customer to understand their plan to rollout GitLab internally and how/where we can help them with adoption.
* For current EE users who are above their license utilization, you can leverage the data to engage the customer.  Celebrate the adoption of GitLab within their organization.  Ask why the adoption took off?  How they are using it (use cases)? Engage them in amending their contract right now for the add-on? Update the renewal opportunity to reflect the increase in usage for the true-up and new renewal amount.
* For current EE users who are not using a EE feature, i.e. CI or issues, you can engage the customer to understand why they are not using it.  Do they know we offer it? Are they using a competitive tool?  Have the integrated their current tool into GitLab? Are they open to learning more about what we offer to replace their current tool?
* For EE trials.  What EE features are they using and not using? If using a EE feature, what are they trying to solve and evaluate? If not using, why and are they open to evaluating that feature?

Here is a [Training Video](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B41DBToSSIG_WU9LZ0o0ektEd0E) to explain in greater detail.

### Requesting assistance/introductions into prospects from our investors

We have great investors who can and want to help us penetrate accounts.  Each month we send out an investor update and within this update there will be a section called "Asks".  Within this section, we can ask investors for any introductions into strategic accounts.
To make a request, within the Account object in Salesforce, use the chatter function and type in "I'd like to ask our investors for help within this account".  Please cc me and your manager within the chatter message.  All requests should be made before the 1st
of the month so they be included in the upcoming investor update.

If an investor can help, they will contact the CRO and the CRO will introduce the salesperson and the investor.  Salesperson shall ask how the investor wants to be updated on progress and follow up accordingly.

### Parent and Child Accounts

* A Parent Account is the business/organization which owns another business/organization.  Example: The Walt Disney Company is the parent account of Disney-ABC Television Group and Disney.com.
* A Child Account is the organization you may have an opportunity with but is owned by the Parent Account. A Child Account can be a business unit, subsidiary, or a satellite office of the Parent Account.
* You may have a opportunity with the Parent account and a Child Account.  Example: Disney and ESPN may both be customers and have opportunities. However, the very first deal with a Parent Account, whether it is with the Parent Account or Child Account, should be marked as "New Business". All other deals under the Parent Account will fall under Add-On Business, Existing Account - Cross-Sell, or Renewal Business (see Opportunity Types section).
* If the Parent and Child accounts have the same company name, either add the division, department, business unit, or location to the end of the account name. For example, Disney would be the name of the Parent Account, but the Child Account would be called The Walt Disney Company Latin America or The Walt Disney Company, Ltd Japan.
* When selling into a new division (which has their own budget, different mailing address, and decision process) create a new account.  This is the Child Account.  For every child account, you must select the parent account by using the parent account field on the account page. If done properly, the Parent/Child relationship will be displayed in the Account Hierarchy section of the account page.
* Remember that a child account can also be a parent account for another account. For example, Disney-ABC Television Group is the child for The Walt Disney Company, but is the parent for ABC Entertainment Group.
* We want to do this as we can keep each opportunity with each child account separate and easily find all accounts and opportunities tied to a parent account, as well as roll-up all Closed Won business against a Parent Account.

### When to create an Opportunity

Before a lead is converted or an opportunity is created the following must occur:

1. Authority
  * What role does this person play in the decision process? (i.e. decision maker, influencer, etc.) OR is this someone that has a pain and a clear path to the decision maker
1. Need
  *Identified problem GitLab can solve
1. Required Information
  * Number of potential EE users
  * Current technologies and when the contract is up
  * Current business initiatives
1. Handoff
  * The prospect is willing to schedule another meeting with the salesperson to uncover more information and uncover technical requirements and decision criteria
1. Interest by GitLab salesperson to pursue the opportunity.  Are you interested in investing time in pursuing this opportunity.


### Reseller Opportunities

Opportunities utilizing a reseller require slightly different data:

* Opportunity Name:
If the partner is an authorized reseller, rename the opportunity with the partner’s nick-name in front, then a dash.  For instance; if it is a Perforce deal, the opportunity name should start with P4 - (whatever your opportunity name is)  This is important for the workflow that solicits updates from the reseller.

* Account Name:
It is important that opportunities using a reseller are created on the END CUSTOMER’s account, and not the reseller’s account.  The account name on an opportunity is never a reseller.  Resellers do not buy licenses; they purchase them on the behalf of an end customer.  For instance, the account name field on an opportunity should never be SHI.

* Opportunity Owner:
Should be the name of the AE who is working the deal with the reseller

* Associating Contact Roles:
After creating the opportunity, click “New” in the contact section to associate contacts with the opportunity.
 - The primary contact should always be a contact at the end user’s account and not a contact at the reseller.  This is important as resellers come and go, and if we do not capture the contact at the end user account, we will not be able to sell to this account if the reseller ends their relationship with us or with the end account.
 - A reseller contact (say, the sales rep at ReleaseTEAM) can, and should be added to the opportunity with the role of Influencer.  NOTE: A contact that works for a reseller should never be added to an end user account.  For instance an employee of SoftwareOne should be a contact of the SoftwareOne account only, and not the Boeing account.

* Associating Partners to an Opportunity:
After creating the opportunity, click “New” in the Partners section to associate the reseller with the opportunity.
 - You can associate multiple partners with an opportunity if there is more than one reseller involved in the opportunity.  This is not uncommon for government opportunities, or opportunities where the customer is asking multiple fulfillment houses (like SHI and SoftwareOne) to fulfill the order.

Gitorious Opportunities:

- Example Acme, Inc - Gitorious- 50 EE


### Opportunity Types

1. New Business - This type should be used for any new subscription who signs up either through the sales team or via the web portal. Paid training also falls under this type if the organization does not have an enterprise license. If an existing account is purchasing a new license for another GitLab instance, this will be new business.
1. Add-on Business- This type should be used for any incremental/upsell business sold into an existing subscription division mid term, meaning not at renewal. This may be additional seats for their subscription or an upgrade to their plan. If an existing account is adding a new subscription, this would be new business, not an add-on.
1. Renewal - This type should be used for an existing account renewing their license with GitLab.  Renewals can have their value increased, decreased, or stay the same.  We capture incremental annual contract value growth/loss as a field in Salesforce.com

### Deal Sizes

Deal Size is a dimension by which we will measure stage to stage conversions and stage cycle times. Values are in USD.

1. Jumbo- any opportunity equal or greater than USD 100,000.
1. Big- any opportunity between USD 25,000 and USD 99,999.99.
1. Medium- any opportunity between USD 5,000 and USD 24,999.99.
1. Small- any opportunity below USD 5,000.

### Tracking Proof of Concepts (POCs)

In Stage 3-Technical Evaluation, a prospect or customer may engage in a proof of concept as part of the evaluation. If they decide to engage, please fill in the following information, as we will use this to track existing opportunities currently engaged in a POC, as well as win rates for customers who have engaged in a POC vs. those that do not.

1. In the opportunity, go to the 3-Technical Evaluation Section.
1. In the POC Status field, you can enter the status of the POC. The options are Not Started, Planning, In Progress, Completed, or Cancelled.
1. Enter the POC Start and End Dates.
1. Enter any POC Notes.
1. Enter the POC Success Criteria, ie how does the prospect/customer plan to determine whether the POC was successful or not.

### Escalation to Support

During the sales cycle potential customers that have questions that are not within the scope of sales can have their queries escalated in different ways depending on the account size:

1. For Large accounts that will have a dedicated Solutions Architect, engage the SA so that they can triage and develop the request.
1. For questions that you think technical staff can answer in < 10 minutes, see the [internal support](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/#internal-support-for-gitlab-team-members) section of the support handbook.
1. If a potential customer has already asked you a question, forward a customer question via email to the **support-trials** email address. - It's important the email is **forwarded** and not CC'd to avoid additional changes required once the support request is lodged.

### Contributing to EE Direction

Being in a customer facing role, salespeople are expected to contribute to [GitLab Direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/).  Each day we talk to customers and prospects we have the opportunity to hear of a feature they find valuable or to give feedback (positive and constructive) to an EE feature that there is an issue for.
When you hear of feedback or you personally have feedback, we encourage you to comment within the issue, if one exists, or create your own issue on our [EE Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues). Checking the [GitLab Direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/) page and the [EE Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues) should happen throughout the week.

When you have an organization that is interested in an EE feature and you have commented in the issue and added a link to the account in salesforce, please follow the process outlined on the [product handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#example-a-customer-has-a-feature-request) to arrange a call with the product manager and account to further discuss need of feature request.

### Export Control Classification, and Countries We Do Not Do Business In

GitLab's Export Control Classification (or ECCN) is 5D002.c.1 with CCATS number G163509.
This means that GitLab source code can be exported and re-exported under the authority of license exception TSU of section [740.13(e)](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_view/986-740) of the export administration regulations (EAR).

Per [740.13(e)(2)(ii)](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_view/986-740) of the EAR, there are restrictions on "Any knowing export or reexport
to a country listed in [Country Group E:1 in Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_download/944-740-supp-1)".

As a consequence of this classification, we currently do not do business in Iran, Sudan (excluding South Sudan), Syria, North Korea, and Cuba.
