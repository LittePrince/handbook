We're a **distributed**, **remote-only** company where people work remotely without missing out.
For this, we use **asynchronous communication** and are as open as we can be by communicating through public issues, chat channels,
and placing an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down.
These communication guidelines are meant to facilitate smooth communication in an
ever-growing remote-only company.
Please keep in mind that you represent GitLab and our culture, also on Social Media.
When commenting on posts please keep in mind: "Don't argue but represent."

### 内部沟通

1. 所有沟通都应该使用中文或英文，即使一对一沟通，因为有时候你需要转发email或者聊天记录。
1. 使用 **异步沟通** 如果可以的话 (用issues和email代替聊天工具), 使用issues比电子邮件更好, 电子邮件比聊天工具更好, 公告在进行团队议程时发布, 并且 [大家应该在没有聊天工具打扰的情况下工作](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.21t7089jk). 使用邮件代替聊天工具。就像和使用聊天工具一样，使用内部的短邮件来发送信息和沟通。不要发送像hi Emma这样的浪费时间的信息，首先复制粘贴email的主题到邮件正文中。因为不是随时有时间，一边按照计划工作一边等邮件回复或聊天工具提醒是非常好的工作方法。
1. 有时候异步沟通是比较好的选择，但是不是默认的沟通方式。面对面或视频[guidelines on video chats](#video-chats)沟通是更好的方式。
1. 尽量多问问题，但是问的时候，尽量多带些人，人越多回答的就越多，也会有更多人看到答案。(所以使用issues或开一个聊天群来代替一对一的email)，并且一定要把答案记到文档中。
1. 如果你提醒一些事情(合并请求，issue，提交内容，网页，评论或其他)，请附上链接。
1. 所有公司的文档应该默认 **共享** ，不要使用本地文件而要在对应的issue上提交评论或说明。

#### Email

1. 当使用电子邮件时，每封邮件发送一封电子邮件，因为一封邮件中的多个项目会导致延误(需要回复所有事情)或遗漏(忘记其中的一项内容)。
1. 回复电子邮件，即使什么都不用干。这样可以让其他人知道你收到了。你简单的回复了OK、谢谢或已完成，这事就完了。
1. 如果你转发了一个没有回复的电子邮件，那么加上FYI (for your information) 或 FYA (for your action)。如果你转发了一个包含FYA的外部的请求，这不代表公司必须做上面提出的要求，只是代表了那个转发的人不跟踪这个请求了，希望你来代替他跟踪这事。
1. 详细的邮件转发规则请参考：暂无
1. 电子邮件时异步的，例如：如果你经理周末给你发邮件，那么你到工作时间再回复邮件也是可以的。
1. 如果邮件很紧急，那么通过即时聊天工具来讨论邮件内容也是可以的。

#### Chat

1. 如果你使用聊天工具，请尽可能使用公共频道，如果需要的话，请提醒你要联系的人。这样可以保证其他人很容易提出意见，如果需要的话也很容易让其他人参与进来。
1. 在聊天中，尽量少用提醒全部人员的功能。这个功能只用在那些紧急且重要的事情上，而不只是重要的事情。如果全员提醒用的太多，会导致对单个人员的提醒淹没在大量的提醒中，使之变得不能及时看到。
如果哪些事情紧急且重要:
   * 使用 `@here` 提醒这个房间所有 _在线_ 成员。
   * 使用 `@channel` 提醒 _所有_ 这个房间的人员, 不管是不是不在线状态。
1. 如果要开视频电话，别人问你要不要视频电话，要么直接发起视频电话或说完"好"以后就等那边建立会话。而不要说完"好"以后等5秒你也开始建立会话，这样就会导致你们同时建立会话，而造成连不上的问题。


#### Google Docs

1. Never use a Google Doc / Presentations for something non-confidential that has to end up on the website or the **handbook**. Work on these edits via commits to a merge request. Then link to the merge request or diff to present the change to people. This prevents a duplication of effort and/or an out of date handbook.
1. If you _do_ need a Google Doc, create one with your company G Suite (formerly Google
Apps) account. By default, share it with the whole company using the _Anyone at GitLab can find and access_ link sharing permission
and the _Anyone within GitLab can edit_ access permission (preferred) or the _Anyone within GitLab can comment_ access permission.
Easily do this by creating Google Docs within a Shared Folder in Google Drive.
1. When referring to a Google Doc in the handbook, refrain from directly linking it. Instead, indicate the name of the doc.
(In the past, linking a Google Doc has led to inadvertently opening the sharing settings beyond what was intended.)
This also helps prevent spam from people outside GitLab requesting accessing to a doc when clicking its link.
1. If you are having trouble finding a shared Google Doc, make sure you [Search &lt;your domain&gt;](https://support.google.com/a/answer/3187967?hl=en) in Google Drive.
1. In our handbook, if you find yourself wondering whether it is better to provide a public link to a Google Doc vs. writing out the content on the website, use the following guideline: Is this document frequently adapted / customized? If yes, then provide a link, making sure that the document can be _commented on_ by _anyone_ with the link. For instance, this is how we share our employment [contracts](/handbook/contracts/). If the document is rarely customized, then provide the content directly on the site and deprecate the Google Doc.

#### Video Chats

1. Use video calls if you find yourself going back and forth in an issue/via email
or over chat. Rule of thumb: if you have gone back and forth 3 times, it's time
for a video call.
1. Having pets, children, significant others, friends, and family visible during
video chats is encouraged. If they are human, ask them to wave at your remote
team member to say "Hi".

#### Say Thanks

1. Thank people that did a great job in our "Thanks" chat channel. If someone is
a team member just @ mention them. If multiple people were working on something
try mentioning each person by "@name". "Thanks everyone" does not say much.
1. To thank someone who is not a team member, mention your manager, our People Ops Coordinator, the name of the person, a quirky gift
and link to their work. For example, "@manager, @peopleopscoordinator: Joe deserves a lawnmower for _link_".
With your manager's blessing, the People Ops Coordinator will approach the person in question for their address saying we want to send
some swag. We'll ship it in gift wrap with "Thanks for your great work on _link_, love
from @gitlab".
1. Don't thank the CEO or other executives for something that the company paid for, thank GitLab instead.

#### 不知道去哪？(Not sure where to go?)

如果有些事情想讨论，但觉得和你的主管或经理讨论都不太合适，你可以直接联系任何你觉得合适讨论的人。

### GitLab Workflow

#### 所有的事情开始于建立issue(事务、工单、问题)

1. 要干任何事前都要 **建立** 一个issue。如果这个事情值得花时间做，那么就值得花一点时间建立一个issue，这样的话，其他人就可以知道你在干啥，并且帮助你。你可以根据事情的进展随时修改描述或者关闭这个issue。
1. 如果有人提出了功能提升的建议，那么就想办法找找有没有哪个issue和他们的建议相似，或者建立一个新issue。然后找他们看能不能把改进建议提交到这个issue上。
1. 双链接issues 会造成内部混乱，导致无法给reporters汇报。例如xxx......如果你不负责汇报，请不要关闭这个issue，而是重新指派这个issue。**Double link** issues to prevent internal confusion and us failing to report back to the reporters. For example, open an issue with a link to ZenDesk and close the issue with a copy of the response. Or add "Report: " lines to the description with links to relevant issues and feature requests and ensure they are closed and note this with a comment. If you are not responsible for reporting back please do not close an issue, instead re-assign it.
1. 如果两个issue相关，则给他们建立一个 **交叉链接** (在相关的两个issue上都建立对方的链接)。 做法是：在两个issue的最顶端放上链接，并对他们之间的关系进行简短描述(报告或其他东西)。 如果不止两个issues，将一个issue当作中心issue，并建立把所有issue的交叉连接都连到这个issue上。
1. 在讨论完功能后，一定要把达成的共识或结论 **更新到issue中** 。 这样才更容易看到这个issue的状态。 并且每个包括没有一起讨论的人，以后都可以根据这个更新内容来实现功能。 而且可以避免混乱和再次讨论。
1. 提交 **最小的**工作项是比较合理的。 创建issue时，尽可能地描述一个比较小的修补程序(可以比较快完成)。 针对不同的issues提出改进建议，并将它们联系起来。 如果要写文档或说明，请首先提交一个最多20行的合并请求。
1. 不要让issues打开以后好长时间没人管，issues应该是 **可操作** 和 **可实现** 的。 如果被指派一个issue但没时间去做，请将它指派给其他人。
1. 要有意识地 **优先** 考虑你的工作。 每项工作的优先级取决于多个因素： 有没有团队成员在等候回答？ 这个工作延迟以后的影响是什么？ 有多少人被这事影响？ 有没有其他方面的影响？ 这个是详细的[Engineering Workflow](../engineering/workflow)。
1. 使用公共issue跟踪页面，来跟踪所有的事情。每个项目都有各自相关的issue跟踪页面。
1. 选择目前 **里程碑** 中的issues进行工作。例如：[milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/milestones).
1. 一般情况下尽量不指派issues，让大家在里程碑中 **自己选issues**。
1. 如果准备做哪个issue，那么就先指派给自己。 但不要晚于你开始工作的时间。 如果完成了这个issue的一部分，并且需要其他人再做下一步工作，那么就 **重新指派** 这个issue给那个人。
1. 在重新指派一个issue前，要确保issue中有最新的进展信息。 issue的内容应该是 **唯一正确的信息来源**。
1. 在处理一个issue时，尽量 **寻求同事的反馈** 例如：如果你是设计师，并且提出了一个设计，让一个同事复查(review)一下你的设计。如果他们赞同了，那么就可以进行下一步工作了。如果提出了建议，你就有机会提升你的设计了。 这样促进了协作，提升了每个人的技能。
1. 我们信守 **诺言**，但不达成 **内部共识** 就不对外许诺言。
1. 在一个issue **[完成][d-o-d]** 前，不允许关闭它。
1. 在 **关闭** 一个issue时，提交一个说明解释一下为什么关闭这个issue。

[d-o-d]: ../engineering/CONTRIBUTING.md#definition-of-done

#### 使用合并请求来实现一个功能(Implement it with a merge request)

Merge request guidelines for all contributors are described in our [Contribution
guide][mr-guidelines].

Code review guidelines for reviewers and maintainers are described in our [Code
Review Guidelines][code-review-guidelines].

Following are additional guidelines for GitLab Inc. team
members:

1. Even when something is not done, share it internally so people can comment
  early and prevent rework. Create a **[Work In
  Progress](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/01/08/feature-highlight-wip/)** a merge request so it is not merged by accident.
1. If any followup actions are required on the issue after the merge request is
  merged (like reporting back to any customers or writing documentation), avoid
  auto closing it.
1. When _you_ are done with your merge request, remove the "WIP" prefix and
  follow the [Code Review Guidelines][code-review-guidelines].
1. You can still make changes based on feedback of course, but by removing the
  "WIP" prefix it clarifies that the main body of work has been completed.

[mr-guidelines]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#merge-request-guidelines

### Team Call

1. Schedule
   * PST: <span id="main-PST"></span>
   * UTC: <span id="main-UTC"></span>
   * <span id="main-abbr"></span>: <span id="main-USER"></span>
1. APAC schedule
   * PST: <span id="apac-PST"></span>
   * UTC: <span id="apac-UTC"></span>
   * <span id="apac-abbr"></span>: <span id="apac-USER"></span>
1. Everyone at GitLab is invited to the team call.
1. There is an additional makeup team call on Fridays where anyone who missed their weekend update can share what they have been up to. Optionally, team members can share an update if they feel so inclined. Please add your name to the list for that day. 
1. We also have a team call for GitLabbers in the APAC region to share their weekend update. This call will also be recorded so the rest of the team can see what their colleagues have been up to! Everyone is encouraged to join this call as well, but it is not mandatory.
1. Every last Friday of the month we have an AMA to talk about anything our team is thinking about.
1. We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for the call since Google Hangouts is capped at 15 people (please be sure to mute your microphone). The link is in the calendar invite and also listed at the top of the team agenda Google Doc called _Team Agenda_.
1. The call is recorded automatically, and all calls are transferred every hour to a Google Drive folder called "GitLab Videos". There is a subfolder called "GitLab Team Call", which is accessible to all users with a GitLab.com e-mail account.
1. We start on time and will not wait for people.
1. The person who has the first item on the agenda starts the call.
1. If you are unable to attend just add your name to the team agenda as "Not attending".
1. We start by discussing the subjects that are on the agenda for today.
   * Everyone is free to add subjects. Please start with your name and be sure to link to an issue, merge request or commit if it is relevant.
   * When done with a point mention the subject of the next item and hand over to the next person.
   * When someone passes the call to you, no need to say, “Can you hear me?” Just begin talking. If we can’t hear you, we’ll let you know.
1. New team members should connect to their first team call 10 minutes before the call starts to make sure Zoom, your camera, and your microphone are all working properly. The new team member's manager will introduce them and ask the following questions: "Tell us about where you were before GitLab, why you wanted to join our team, and what you like to do in your spare time."
1. We ask 15-20 people per day to share updates about the most exciting thing from your past or upcoming week/weekend. If anyone has something they'd like to talk about, last person in the list will ask the group if they have anything else to share.
   * The team agenda lists who is meant to speak on which day; this can be altered daily if conflicts arise.
   * There is no need to excuse yourself with "I didn't do anything interesting", "I just watched television" or "That's all". It is not a competition. Instead share the most interesting detail, for example what television show you watched, book you are reading, video game you played or what recipe you cooked.
1. The sequence of asking people is in a random order where each team member is assigned a day. Since we are growing rapidly, GitLabbers share their weekend update every two weeks. Days are split into group A and group B, which alternates depending on the week. People Ops will denote on the agenda which group will share that day. New GitLabbers will share every week for the first three months on Wednesdays. If there are non-team page people in the call we end with those.
1. It is OK to talk over people or interrupt people to ask questions, cheer for them or show your compassion. This to encourage more conversation and feedback in the call.
1. Please look if the person you hand over to is present in the participant list so you don't hand over to someone who is not present.
1. The last person wishes everyone a good day.
1. Even if you cannot join the call, consider reviewing the recorded call or at minimum read through the team agenda and the links from there. We often use the team call to make announcements or discuss changes in processes, so make sure to catch up on the news if you have missed a team call (or more).

### 发布回顾和启动(Release Retrospectives and Kickoffs)
{: #kickoffs}

After GitLab releases a new version on the 22nd of each month, we have a
30-minute call on the next business day reflecting on what could have been
better:

1. What went well this month?
2. What went wrong this month?
3. What could we have done better?

We spend the first part of the retrospective meeting reviewing the action
items from the previous month.

After the retrospective meeting is done, we launch immediately into the
kickoff meeting. The product team and other leads will have already have had
some discussion in a [meta issue on the GitLab.com CE
tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?scope=all&state=opened&label_name=meta)
on what should be prioritized for each release. The purpose of this kickoff is
to get everyone on the same page and to invite comments.

We will post the recordings of the kickoff and retrospective to YouTube and
share the notes publicly.

### Random Chat and Room
{: #random-room}

1. The [#random](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/random) chat channel is your go-to place to share random ideas, pictures, articles, and more. It's a great channel to check out when you need a mental break.
1. Come hang out any time in the **random room**, an open Google Hangout video chat where anyone with a GitLab email address can come and leave as they please. The link is in the description of the `#random` chat channel; consider bookmarking it. This room is open for all and should be distinct from the [Coffee Break Calls](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/working-remotely/#coffee-break-calls), which are 1x1 conversations between teammates.

### 安排会议(Scheduling Meetings)

1. If you want to ask GitLabbers if they are available for an event please send a new calendar appointment from and to the company address. This makes it easier for people to check availability and to put on their calendar. It automatically shows up on calendars even when the email is not opened. It is easier to signal presence and to see the status of everyone. Please respond quickly to invites so people can make plans.
1. Every scheduled meeting should either have a Google Presentation (for example for functional updates that don't require participation) or a Google Doc (for most meetings) linked. If it is a Google Doc it should have an agenda, including any preparation materials (can be a presentation). Put the agenda in a Google Doc that has edits rights for all participants (including people not part of GitLab Inc.). Link the Google Doc from the meeting invite. Take notes of the points and todo's during the meeting. Nobody wants to write up a meeting after the fact and this helps to structure the thought process and everyone can contribute. Being able to structure conclusions and follow up actions in realtime makes a video call more effective than an in-person meeting. If it is important enough to schedule a meeting it is important enough to have a Doc linked. If we want to be on the same page we should be looking at that page.
1. If you want to check if a team member is available for an outside meeting, create a calendar appointment and invite the team member only, after they respond yes then invite outside people.
1. When scheduling a call with multiple people, invite them using a Google Calendar that is your own, or one specific to the people joining, so the calendar item
doesn't unnecessarily appear on other people's calendars.
1. If you want to move a meeting just move the calendar appointment instead of reaching out via other channels, note the change at the top of the description.
1. Please click 'Guests can modify event' so people can update the time in the calendar instead of having to reach out via other channels. You can install [the Google-Calendar-Guests-Can-Modify-Event-By-Default plugin in Chrome](https://github.com/robin-drexler/Google-Calendar-Guests-Can-Modify-Event-By-Default) to do this automatically.
1. If you want to schedule a meeting with a person not on the team please use [Calendly](#calendly).
1. When scheduling a meeting we value people's time and prefer the "speedy meetings" setting in our Google Calendar. This gives us meetings of, for example, 25 or 50  minutes leaving some time to write notes etc before continuing to our next call or meeting. (This setting can be found under the calendar Settings menu at "default event duration")
1. When creating a calendar event that will be used company wide, please place it on the GitLab Availability Calendar. That way the event is easily located by all individuals.
1. When you need to cancel a meeting, make sure to delete/decline the meeting and choose the option **Delete & update guests** to make sure everyone knows you can't attend and don't wait for you.

### Video Calls

1. For smaller meetings we use Google Hangouts or [Appear.in](https://appear.in/), for larger meetings we prefer [Zoom](https://gitlab.zoom.us/) (Google Hangouts technical limit is 15 for scheduled meetings).
1. For meetings that are scheduled via calendar there is automatically a Google Hangout URL added, this is the meeting place. Having a url in advance is much more reliable than trying to call via hangouts as the meeting start.
1. Google Calendar also has a [Zoom plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zoom-scheduler/kgjfgplpablkjnlkjmjdecgdpfankdle?hl=en-US) where you can easily add a Zoom link for a videocall to the invite
1. For meetings that are scheduled with Zoom, make sure to take out the Google Hangout link to avoid confusion.
   1. If you need more privileges on Zoom (longer meeting times, more people in the meeting, etc.), please contact People Ops as described [specifically for Zoom](/handbook/tools-and-tips/#sts=Zoom).
   1. Note that if you select to record meetings to the cloud (setting within Zoom), they will be automatically placed in the GitLab Videos folder in Google Drive; on an hourly basis. You can find these videos in Google Drive by entering in the search bar: `title:"GitLab Videos" source:domain`.
   1. Note also that after a meeting ends, Zoom may take some to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred.
1. Use a headset with a microphone, [Apple Earpods](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD827LL/A/apple-earpods-with-remote-and-mic) are great. Do not use computer speakers, they cause an echo. Do not use your computer microphone, it accentuates background noise. If you want to use your [Bose headphones](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-25-acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones-apple-devices.html#v=qc25_black) that is fine but please ensure the microphone is active.
1. Consider using a utility to easily mute/unmute yourself, see [Shush](#shush) in the tools section.
1. In video calls everyone should own camera and headset, even when they are in the same room. This helps to see the person that is talking clearly on the camera and their name in the list. It also allows people to easily talk and mute themselves. And using a headset prevents an echoing. You wouldn't share an office seat together, don't share your virtual seat at the table.

### 用户沟通指南(User Communication Guidelines)

1. Keep conversations positive, friendly, real, and productive while adding value.
1. If you make a mistake, admit it. Be upfront and be quick with your correction. If you're posting to a blog, you may choose to modify an earlier post, just make it clear that you have done so.
1. There can be a fine line between healthy debate and incendiary reaction. Try to frame what you write to invite differing points of view without inflaming others. You don’t need to respond to every criticism or barb. Be careful and considerate.
1. Answer questions, thank people even if it’s just a few words. Make it a two way conversation.
1. Appreciate suggestions and feedback.
1. Don't make promises that you can't keep.
1. Guide users who ask for help or give a suggestion and share links. [Improving Open Development for Everyone](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/12/16/improving-open-development-for-everyone/), [Types of requests](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/12/08/explaining-gitlab-bugs/).
1. When facing negative comment, respond patiently and treat every user as an individual, people with the strongest opinions can turn into [the strongest supporters](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/05/20/gitlab-gitorious-free-software/).

### 写作风格指南(Writing Style Guidelines)

1. {: #american-english} At GitLab, we use American English as the standard written language.
1. Do not use rich text, it makes it hard to copy/paste. Use [Markdown](http://doc.gitlab.com/user/markdown.html) for things stored in git. In Google Docs use 'Normal text' using the style/heading/formatting dropdown and paste without formatting.
1. Don't use ALL CAPS because if feels like shouting.
1. We use Unix style (lf) line endings, not Windows style (crlf), please ensure `*.md text eol=lf` is set in the repository's `.gitattributes` and run `git config --global core.autocrlf input` on your client.
1. Do not create links like "here" or "click here". All links should have relevant anchor text that describes what they link to, such as: "GitLab CI source installation documentation".
1. Always use [ISO dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Calendar_dates) in all writing and legal documents since other formats [lead to online confusion](http://xkcd.com/1179/), so use `yyyy-mm-dd`, for example 2015-04-13, and never 04-13-2015, 13-04-2015, nor 2015/04/13.
1. If you have multiple points in a comment or email, please number them to make replies easier.
1. When you reference an issue, merge request, comment, commit, page, doc, etc. and you have the URL available please paste that in.
1. In making URLs, always prefer hyphens to underscores, and always use lowercase.
1. The community include users, contributors, core team members, customers, people working for GitLab Inc., and friends of GitLab. If you want to refer to 'people not working for GitLab Inc.' just say that and don't use the word community. If you want to refer to people working for GitLab Inc. you can also use 'the GitLab Inc. team' but don't use the 'GitLab Inc. employees'.
1. When we refer to the GitLab community excluding GitLabbers please say 'wider community' instead of 'community'.
1. All people working for GitLab the company are the [GitLab team](https://about.gitlab.com/team/), we also have the [Core team](https://about.gitlab.com/core-team/) that consists of volunteers.
1. Please always refer to GitLab Inc. people as GitLabbers, not employees.
1. Use inclusive and gender-neutral language in all writing. So for example, write "they, their" instead "he, his".
1. Always write GitLab with a capitalized G and L, even when writing GitLab.com.
1. Always capitalize the names of GitLab [features](https://about.gitlab.com/features/)
1. Do not use a hyphen when writing the term "open source."
1. Monetary amounts shouldn't have one digit, so prefer $19.90 to $19.9
1. If an email needs a response write the ask at the top of it.
1. Use the future version of words, just like we don't write internet with a capital anymore, we write frontend and webhook without a hyphen or space.
1. Our homepage is https://about.gitlab.com/ (with the `about.` and with `https`).
1. Try to use the [active voice](https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/CCS_activevoice.html) whenever possible.
1. Please refer to self-hosted installations as on-premises, not on-premise.
1. If you use headers properly format them (`##` in Markdown, "Heading 2" in Google docs), start at the second header level because header level 1 is for titles, do not end headers with a colon.
1. Always use an [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) in lists of three or more terms.
1. Always use a single space between sentences rather than two.
1. Read our [Documentation Styleguide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/doc_styleguide.md) for more information when writing documentation.
1. Do not use acronyms when you can avoid it as you can't assume people know what you are talking about. Example: instead of `MR`, write `merge request`
2. We segment our customers/prospects into 4 segments [Strategic, Large, Mid-Market and Small Medium Business (SMB)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/#market-segmentation).

### Beamy Guidelines

Beamy is our company conference call robot. It lives in the San Francisco Howard St. office.
Its main purpose is to allow those outside of the office a view into the space and people.
When you call in to the beam your face will appear on the screen (so make sure your webcam
works) and you can drive the robot around the office. It simulates being in the space without
physically being there. It is really cool and everyone should try it and have fun with it.

* You need an invite email to connect and to download a desktop client, please @mention Emily in the #general channel if you don't have the invite yet.
* **Beamy times**: 8am until 6pm Pacific time. [Please check the current time!](https://time.is/San_Francisco) on workdays and during all company events, for other times please @mention Sytse in the Slack #valley channel to see if it is OK. It is on auto connect so you'll beam right in.
* The email invite will come from "Suitable Tech". Once you are sent an invite you can beam in at any time and drive around our beam. Don’t forget to park it back on the charger when you are done. You can do so by driving up to the charger, when you see a green outline press AND HOLD 'p' until it's parked. Make sure it is charging, otherwise try again.
* If you don't use headphones be careful about your volume and microphone placement, it might start singing, if so immediately mute your microphone and switch to headphones.
* More info can be found at https://www.suitabletech.com/
* Please report any questions or issues you have about the beam in the Slack #peopleops channel.

### Company phone number
{: #phone-number}

If you need to provide the details of GitLab's contact information you can take the [address of the office](https://about.gitlab.com/visiting/) for reference; or the [mailing address](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/#addresses) of the office in the Netherlands if that is more applicable.

If a phone number is required, leave this field empty by default. If that is not possible, then use
the general number (+1-415-761-1791), but be aware that this number simply guides to a voice message that refers the caller back to contacting us via email.
