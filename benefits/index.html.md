## General Benefits

1. GitLab will pay for the items listed under [spending company money](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money).
1. [Stock options](/handbook/stock-options/) are offered to most GitLabbers.
1.  Deceased team member:
    In the unfortunate event that a GitLab team member passes away, GitLab will
    provide a $20,000 lump sum to anyone of their choosing. This can be a spouse,
    partner, family member, friend, or charity.
      * For US based employees of GitLab Inc., this benefit is replaced by the
        [Basic Life Insurance](#basic-life-ins) that is offered through TriNet.
      * For all other GitLabbers, the following conditions apply:
         * The team member must be either an employee or direct contractor,
         * The team member must have indicated in writing to whom the money
           should be transferred.
         * For part-time GitLabbers, the lump sum is calculated pro-rata, so
           for example for a team member that works for GitLab 50% of the time,
           the lump sum would be $10,000.

## Parental Leave

Anyone (regardless of gender) at GitLab who becomes a parent through childbirth or adoption is able to take fully paid parental leave. GitLabbers will be encouraged to decide for themselves the appropriate amount of time to take and how to take it. We will offer everyone up to 12 weeks of 100% paid time off during the first year of parenthood. We encourage parents to take 8-12 weeks.

For many reasons, a team member may require more time off for parental leave. Many GitLabbers are from countries that have longer standard parental leaves, occasionally births have complications, and sometimes 12 weeks just isn't enough. Any GitLabber can request additional unpaid parental leave, up to 4 weeks. We are happy to address anyone with additional leave requests on a one-on-one basis. All of the parental leave should be taken in the first year.

If you have been at GitLab for a year your parental leave is fully paid. If you've been at GitLab for less than a year it depends on your jurisdiction.

You are entitled to and need to comply with your local regulations. They override our policy.

## Country Specific Leave Requirements

## Specific to US based employees
{: #us-specific-benefits}

US based employees' payroll and benefits are arranged through TriNet. The most up
to date and correct information is always available to employees through the
[TriNet HRPassport portal](https://www.hrpassport.com) and the various contact forms
and numbers listed there. This brief overview is not intended to replace the
documentation in TriNet, but rather to give our GitLabbers and applicants a
quick reference guide.

If you have any questions in regards to your TriNet paycheck log in to TriNet, then go to [How To Read Your Paycheck](https://www.hrpassport.com/Help/Docs/pdf/Readpaycheck_US.pdf).

Carrier ID cards are normally received within 2-3 weeks from when you submit your benefit elections. If you or your medical providers are in need of immediate confirmation of your coverage, please contact the carrier directly.

### Group Medical Coverage

##### Transgender Medical Services

Recently, the [United States Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) released a [mandate on transgender non-discrimination](http://www.transgendermandate.org/). As part of this mandate, medical carriers were given time to review their current policies and update to reflect the mandate. Expanded language for coverage should be visible in the 2017-10-01 renewal for TriNet’s plans.

Because there is a wide range of services, treatment, and goals for transgender patients, employees are encouraged to contact their carrier directly to have these discussions.
