## Master Vendor Agreement

All vendors and suppliers doing business with GitLab will require a contract. If the vendor/supplier does not provide an agreement, then GitLab's Master Vendor Agreement can be used. See [Vendor Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hcO4wH4Z514OtQQSMeollGBqJ6eEIZ6ATOd7DhUwvGM/edit).   If using this Master Vendor Agreement, please provide any changes to the template to Legal for revieww. All agreements must be reviewed and approved by Legal before signing.
